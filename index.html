                        they dictate which types we may use to create multi-million dollar algorithms, tell us what kind of functions they'll happily provide for free, and what they'll
                        make us do ourselves.</p><p><b>The Reign Of C</b><br>C is widely regarded to be one of the most influential programming languages ever created, developed in the early 70s by Dennis Richie at Bell,
                        if provided low-level support for direct interaction with hardware. It was known to be one of the first majorly used programming languages and is immensely important,
                        comprising a significant portion of, for example, the Linux kernel. It also allows direct embeddment of assembly language code too.</p>
